# Capture-multiple-images-with-OpenCv
I've searched thorugh Google but i can't find the right code to capture multiple images using my Webcamera so i created one..
With this code you can capture multiple images as many as you want using your webcam.

Before using this program,
You should have OpenCv module installed to run this program..
If you don't have, you can install it by simply typing the below command in your terminal..

#use pip or pip3 based on your pip version.

-> pip install opencv-python 

you can run this python file using python 3.x version  by simply typing this command

-> open terminal from the folder where this file stored

-> type python3 Capture_Images.py

Now the program wil open your webcam and will start to take pictures.

At first it will take 10 images and then it will terminate..

You can limit how many pictures that you want to take by entering the number in the for loop...

After capturing images, it will be stored in the folder called "Pictures"..

If you have any doubt Contact me and also suppoet me on Socialmedia platforms...
